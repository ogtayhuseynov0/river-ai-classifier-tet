# AI Response System - Simple Overview

## How It Works

```
Customer messages → AI writes response → You review → Send to customer
```

**Three automation levels:**
1. **Manual** - AI suggests, you review and send
2. **Semi-auto** - AI auto-approves good responses, you send
3. **Full-auto** - AI handles everything, sends automatically

## Response Flow

| Step | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. Trigger | Customer messages OR you click "Generate" |
| 2. Generate | AI writes response using your business style |
| 3. Review | Auto-approve if confident, otherwise you review |
| 4. Action | Accept, Reject (with reason), or Reprompt |
| 5. Send | Goes to customer |

## Business DNA (Style Learning)

AI learns how YOUR business communicates by analyzing your past responses:

- Tone (formal/friendly)
- Common phrases you use
- Phrases you avoid
- Response length

**Result:** AI responses sound like you, not a generic bot.
